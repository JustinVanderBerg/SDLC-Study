System
A system is a combination of software and hardware that provides a solution for a business problem. It involves the client, analysts, designers/developers, testers, users and others
Measuring Success
Success of a project may be measured by answering the following questions: Does the project solve what it was meant to solve? Is it easy to maintain and administer? Is it scalable to meet the needs of the client? Is there a successful support system in place for the client? Was it delivered on time and ready to go? Was the client happy with the finished product?
The Software Development Process
Creating high-quality software involves organization, planning and utilizing various diagrammatic conventions. Computer scientists have created a view of the software development process known as the "Software Development Life Cycle" (SDLC). One method is known as the waterfall model.
The Waterfall Model
The Waterfall Model was developed by Dr Winston Royce in 1970, and is based on his experience developing software for spacecraft mission planning. The Water fall cconsists of the following phases: Problem Statement, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Integration/test and maintenance. Mistakes found early in the SDLC are less expensive to correct then those found later.
Project Management Tools
The main 4 tools used are Gantt Charts, UML, daily logs and weekly reports. 
Gantt Chart
The Gantt Chart was developed by mechanical engineer Henry Gantt in the 1910's. It is a tool typically used by people working on a large project. It helps project managers to visualize, schedule and track scheduled, as well as actual progress of projects.
UML
UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. It visually specifies parts of a system. Complex software designs are much more easily described through UML than textually, although it can be complicated to learn.
